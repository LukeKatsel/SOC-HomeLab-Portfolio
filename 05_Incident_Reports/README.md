# 05_Incident_Reports

This section contains detailed write-ups of security incidents simulated within the HomeLab environment. These reports demonstrate the process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity events in a structured and professional manner.

## Objectives

- Document simulated security incidents derived from adversary emulation and PCAP analysis.
- Extract and analyze Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) relevant to each incident.
- Provide threat hunting insights and detection validation.
- Recommend actionable response steps to mitigate and remediate identified threats.
- Showcase communication skills through clear and concise reporting.

## Contents

- **`incident_1_report.md`**  
  A comprehensive report detailing the detection and response to an initial intrusion scenario.

- **`incident_2_report.md`**  
  Analysis and recommendations following a malware infection simulated via Atomic Red Team tests.

- **`ioc_summary.md`**  
  Consolidated list of IOCs across all incidents with context and relevance.

- **`response_recommendations.md`**  
  Suggested remediation and mitigation strategies tailored to the simulated environments.

## Purpose

These reports highlight the critical SOC functions of investigation, documentation, and communication. They reflect an understanding of incident lifecycle management and support for continuous improvement in security posture.

This section ties together the technical skills demonstrated in network setup, detection tuning, adversary emulation, and PCAP analysis to provide a holistic view of SOC operational capabilities.
