# 04_PCAP_Analysis

This section focuses on analyzing network traffic captures (PCAPs) to identify malicious activity and validate detection rules within the Security Onion environment.

## Objectives

- Replay PCAP files using `tcpreplay` to simulate real-world network traffic and attacks.
- Monitor and analyze alerts generated by Suricata and Zeek during replay.
- Perform manual event triage to identify true positives and false positives.
- Extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and document findings.
- Provide detailed incident analysis and recommendations based on the traffic.

## Contents

- **`pcap_files/`**  
  Contains the original and processed PCAP files used for replay and analysis.

- **`replay_commands.md`**  
  Documentation of tcpreplay commands and configurations used to inject traffic into the test network.

- **`alert_logs/`**  
  Exported Suricata and Zeek alert logs generated during PCAP replay.

- **`event_triage_reports.md`**  
  Manual triage notes detailing significant events, threat verification, and analysis results.

- **`ioc_extraction.md`**  
  Summary of extracted IOCs such as malicious IP addresses, domains, file hashes, and behavioral patterns.

## Tools Used

- **tcpreplay** for controlled replay of captured traffic.
- **Security Onion** for real-time detection and alerting.
- **Wireshark** for deep packet inspection and event validation.

## Purpose

Through this hands-on analysis, this project demonstrates:

- The ability to operate network traffic replay tools to simulate attacks.
- Skills in identifying and validating alerts from intrusion detection systems.
- Proficiency in manual investigation and report writing.
- Practical knowledge in extracting and documenting threat intelligence.

This work complements the adversary emulation and incident reporting activities in the portfolio, showcasing end-to-end SOC investigative capabilities.
