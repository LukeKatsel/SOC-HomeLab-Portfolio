# üõ†Ô∏è Detection Engine Tuning in Security Onion

This document details the process of tuning Security Onion‚Äôs primary detection engines ‚Äî Suricata and Zeek ‚Äî to improve alert quality by reducing false positives and noise, and enhancing detection accuracy in a homelab environment.

---

## üß∞ Environment Details

- **Security Onion Version**: 2.4.141 (Standalone Mode)
- **Detection Engines**: Suricata (IDS/IPS), Zeek (Network Security Monitoring)
- **Data Sources**: Mirrored network traffic (SPAN port), pfSense logs (syslog)
- **Objective**: Optimize detection rules for accurate, actionable alerts

---

## üì¶ Tuning Steps

1. **Baseline Alert Collection**

- Allow the system to run with default detection rules for a period (e.g., 1 week) to gather baseline alert data.
- Collect logs from Suricata and Zeek for analysis.

2. **Analyze Alert Volume and Types**

- Use Kibana dashboards to review the types and frequency of alerts generated.
- Identify common false positives or benign events triggering alerts.

3. **Rule Suppression and Customization (Suricata)**

- Use the suricata.yaml configuration to disable or suppress noisy rules.
- Leverage the threshold.config file to set thresholds on alerts to reduce repetitive alerts from the same source.
- Create local rules to fine-tune detection, e.g., whitelist known safe IPs or adjust rule parameters.

4. **Zeek Script Customization**

- Review Zeek logs to identify false positives or unnecessary events.
- Customize Zeek scripts (written in Zeek scripting language) to filter out benign events or add custom detection logic.

5. **Detection Engine Integration and Correlation**

- Tune Elasticsearch queries in Kibana to correlate Suricata and Zeek alerts for higher fidelity.
- Adjust dashboards to focus on prioritized alerts.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop**

- Regularly review alert trends and update tuning rules accordingly.
- Document changes for reproducibility and audit.

## üß© Challenges Encountered
‚ùó Initial high volume of irrelevant alerts due to broad default signatures.

‚ùó Difficulty balancing detection sensitivity vs. noise in a small homelab environment.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Tuning Security Onion‚Äôs detection engines is crucial for actionable threat detection. Through systematic analysis, rule suppression, and customization, the homelab environment now generates higher-quality alerts aligned with simulated threats and realistic network behaviors.
