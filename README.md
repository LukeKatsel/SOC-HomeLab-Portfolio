# SOC Homelab Portfolio

Welcome to my Security Operations Center (SOC) Homelab Portfolio. This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience simulating real-world SOC environments using open-source tools, adversary emulation, and enterprise-grade monitoring setups. This lab was built to mirror the responsibilities of a professional SOC analyst, including event triage, intrusion detection, incident response, and log analysis.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Security Onion** (Zeek, Suricata, Wazuh, Kibana, Elasticsearch)
- **pfSense** firewall for VLAN segmentation, IDS mirroring, and traffic routing
- **Atomic Red Team** for adversary emulation (MITRE ATT&CK-based testing)
- **Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net** PCAPs for replay and analysis
- **Managed Layer 3 Switch (Brocade ICX6450)** for VLAN and port mirroring setup

## 💡 Why This Lab Was Built

This homelab is a personal project to deepen my SOC analysis skills, emulate enterprise-level traffic, and practice threat detection workflows. It reflects my ability to:
- Work independently to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain critical infrastructure
- Simulate realistic attacks and validate defensive controls
- Triage events and write actionable, professional-grade reports
- Communicate technical findings clearly and concisely
